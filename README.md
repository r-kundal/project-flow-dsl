# project-flow-dsl

Initially, there was an idea to create a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for routing operations in a project-specific flow based on git-flow can be a great way to simplify complex Git operations and provide a more streamlined process for developers.

## Intention
Create a robust and user-friendly DSL for routing operations in a project-specific flow using Scala or F# that abstracts away the complexity of Git operations while leveraging the strengths of functional-first programming.

## Roadmap
Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this using functional-first programming languages like F#:

1. **Define the Requirements:**
   - Identify the common Git operations and workflows used in your project.
   - Determine the simplifications or abstractions that can be made to these operations to make them more user-friendly.
   - Define the syntax and semantics of your DSL that will cater to these simplifications.

2. **Design the DSL:**
   - **F#:**
     - Leverage F#'s lightweight syntax and computation expressions to build DSLs.
     - Use pattern matching and active patterns to make the DSL expressive and concise.

3. **Implement Core Functionalities:**
   - Abstract the Git commands into pure functions that represent the core functionalities of your DSL.
   - Ensure that these functions are side-effect-free to maintain referential transparency and make them easier to test.

4. **Create DSL Constructs:**
   - Define higher-level constructs in your DSL that compose the core functionalities into common workflows (e.g., feature start, feature finish, release start, release finish).
   - Implement these constructs in a way that they are easily composable and reusable.

5. **Integrate with Git:**
   - Use appropriate libraries (e.g., [LibGit2Sharp](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp) for F#) to interact with Git repositories.
   - Wrap these library calls in your DSL functions to perform actual Git operations.

6. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for each component of your DSL to ensure correctness.
   - Consider property-based testing to cover a wide range of scenarios and inputs.

7. **Documentation:**
   - Document each part of your DSL thoroughly.
   - Provide examples and use cases to help developers understand how to use the DSL effectively.

8. **Iterate and Refine:**
   - Gather feedback from developers who use the DSL.
   - Iterate on the design and implementation based on the feedback to improve the DSL.

10. **Training and Adoption:**
    - Conduct training sessions to introduce the DSL to your development team.
    - Create guides and tutorials that demonstrate the benefits and usage of the DSL in your specific project context.

By following these steps, you can create a robust and user-friendly DSL for routing operations in a project-specific flow using Scala or F# that abstracts away the complexity of Git operations while leveraging the strengths of functional-first programming.
